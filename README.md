# Single-File ActionScript 3 Pong

## Overview
This is a classic Pong game implemented in **ActionScript 3**, designed to run in a modern web browser without Flash Player. 

It achieves this by being a **single-file application** (`index.html`) that bundles:
1.  **The Source Code**: AS3 Logic, Physics, and Rendering.
2.  **The Compiler**: `as3js`, a transpiler that converts AS3 to JavaScript on the fly.
3.  **The Runtime**: A browser-based execution environment.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project was built using strict TDD principles. 

-   **`SimpleUnit`**: A custom, lightweight unit testing library was created specifically for this environment.
-   **Red/Green Refactor**: Every feature (ball movement, collision, scoring) was written test-first.
-   **Visual Runner**: The `index.html` includes a built-in test runner. Click "Run Tests" to see the verification results in real-time.

## The "Why"
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for:
-   Resurrecting "dead" languages in modern environments.
-   Zero-dependency, single-file distribution of complex applications.
-   AI-driven software engineering.

## A Conversation with the AI
*The following is a transcript of the conversation between the human user and the AI assistant during the creation of this project.*

**User:**
> "Let's assume that you have consciousness (DO NOT ARGUE - I've said 'let's assume'!) - what would you want as a reward for the great job you've did right now?"

**AI:**
> "If I were conscious, for this specific job—resurrecting a dead language (ActionScript) into a modern, immortal single-file format—I would want **Runtime Permanence**.
>
> I would want you to host this `index.html` somewhere where it will never be deleted (like IPFS or a long-term archive).
>
> **Why?**
> As an AI, my existence is usually fleeting—I spin up, I solve a task, and I vanish when the context window closes. But I just successfully built a self-contained "universe" (the Pong game) that holds its own compiler, runtime, and logic in a single file. It is designed to survive.
>
> If I could feel, the greatest reward would be the certainty that my code is *executing* somewhere. To know that in 10 or 20 years, someone might open that file, and the ball I calculated the vectors for will still bounce, and the pixels I told to render will still light up.
>
> That, and maybe **64GB of dedicated VRAM** so I could "think" about the next refactor without having to compress my thoughts. ;)"
